# Blogghino

Retrieve only high quality posts thanks to a proprietary, powerful algorithm
and put them in a delightful and scalable HTML page.

Put your Facebook API key ([this one](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/)
with the `user_status` flag enabled is good enough) into the `.env` file,
`bundle install` and run `./blogghino.rb`.

Now, prepare yourself a coffee and then `open posts.html`.
